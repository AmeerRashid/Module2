I have never done anything like this before and I am very grateful for the FAQ which helped me a lot. 

The FAQ explains how to get the obj. file and extract the data, but my problem was that my model was uploaded to Sketchfab which did not have any files for me to mess around with. I tried going through the model information and the metadata, but on Sketchfab that only gives you the number of faces and vertices without actually giving you the codes for any of that information. I tried to download the model and that was very vague so I was not sure that I was gonna get the files I needed or if it was only going to let me view the model offline. 

The model downloaded as a zip. file and that gave me access to the obj. and texture files, but my laptop was defaulted to open files in Microsoft Word and so when I opened the file it did not give me anything other than the file name written out in Word. 

I tried to reopen the file with different programs, but it still gave me the same thing. I checked the FAQ and saw that I had to use Sublime to open the obj. files. I downloaded Sublime and it finally opened the codes for the vertices. I followed the FAQ once again to figure out how to run the numbers through Musicalgorithms.org. I took lines of code from three different parts of the obj. file to get a larger variety of numbers. I managed to make a song with a lot of different instruments. I had one voice on wooden blocks, one on piano, and the last one on the agogo. After I downloaded the MIDI file the song was all pianos and there was no way to save the file with the different instruments. 

The next step was uploading it to Soundcloud and that created a whole new set of problems because Soundcloud does not accept MIDI files and the track had an error and refused to upload. I had the idea of opening the MIDI file in Audacity and saving it again as an MP3 file, but Audacity would not even play the file at all. 

I asked Google for a converting website and it gave me Zamzar to convert MIDI files into MP3 and it worked. I uploaded the song to Soundcloud and saved the link.
