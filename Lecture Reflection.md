The lecture on Feb.5, 2018, 'History is a Remix' helped me understand that a remix is just simply rearranging the information that is already there. Scary Mary was used as an example to show that all the scenes in the video are already in the movie, but someone moved them around to show a different side of the movie that was meant for kids and turned it into a horror film. This gives people a different perspective on something that has always been considered a kids' movie. It just takes one person to look at it differently and come up with a whole new thing just by using what is already there. The same applies to the data of the Roman coins in Britain. The data is already there, but by listening to it as an audio version allows for a better and quicker understanding of the distribution of these coins. Someone went through a lot of data and they took the time to look at all the information and put it into a different medium to be analyzed faster than before and in a more interesting way.

A remix can also show a different side to a story like the plaques put out by the Department of Recreaction and Conservation in British Columbia. The little signs were meant to be little pieces of historical information scattered around the parks, but they gave a more colonial view of Canadian history and so someone remade them in the same way and style, but the writing on them was changed to portray the realistic side of history and the destruction of Native communities and economies.
